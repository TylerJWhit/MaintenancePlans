# MaintenancePlans
PowerShell scripts for dealing with Maintenance Plans.

So far, only "Verb: Get" is supported and is very customised to personal situation.
  More work needed to make it non-customised.
  
Potentially create a cmdlet for "Verb: Remove".<br />
I have no interest at a "Verb: Add, Set" but if anyone wants to give it a go, be my guest!
